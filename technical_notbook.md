**Technical notebook:** this document keeps track of some of the assumptions we've discussed so far:

1.  **Traffic weights:** we will assume the traffic weights for 2019 because 2020 traffic was heavily affected by COVID
2.  **What tracts to ommit:** we will ommit tracts **9801** and **9802** because they cover Arlington Cemetery, and tract **103801** because it covers much of Joint Base Myer-Henderson.
3.   **Related to JBMH:** how do we treat commissaries? 
4.  **Criteria for charitable sites:** focus on sites that target all families and that have convenient hours. We can identify food sites that are less convenient timewise. However, food sites that target specific populations may need to be analyzed separately. We would need to analyze targeted foodsites as they relate to the populations they target, such as elders and children.
5.  **CACFP and other food supports:** we may need to mention these, but our budget may not support a full analysis of foodsites covered by programs such as CACFP.
6.   **Times for retail (EBT and non-EBT):** WHAT ARE THE TIMES THAT WE SELECTED - NEED TO UPDATE!
